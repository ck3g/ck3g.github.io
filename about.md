I'm **Vitaly Tatarintsev**, a developer who constantly seek for new knowledge and like to hone my skills.


I'm using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) as my primary development tools.
But I also learn other stuff.
At the moment, for example, I'm learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming language along with the [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/) framework.
More than that, I'm also documenting the process of the learning.


If you want to hear more about stuff I have learned, feel free to subscribe down below.
